As\n                  soon as you find out you are pregnant, you should make an\n                  appointment to see your health care provider, a midwife or a\n                  physician (in some medical practices, both are in the same\n                  office). Health insurance options have changed over time, and\n                  most offer pregnant women more options. Insurance companies\n                  are learning it is important to provide prenatal care to\n                  prevent more expensive medical care later. Local hospitals,\n                  clinics, and other government programs are available to help\n                  with:\n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>food</li>\n                  <li>nutrition</li>\n                  <li>counselling</li>\n                  <li>free access to health services for pregnant women</li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Pregnancy_data;\n","import { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Link, NavLink } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport \"./css/Heading.css\";\nimport \"./css/hover_css.css\";\nimport Pregnancy_data from \"./Pregnancy_data\";\nfunction Pregnancy() {\n  const css_Default = \"card-title aaa black_text\";\n  const [value, setvalue] = useState(\"\");\n  const [css1, setcss1] = useState(css_Default);\n  const [css2, setcss2] = useState(css_Default);\n  const [css3, setcss3] = useState(css_Default + \" aa\");\n\n  const p = (e) => {\n    if (e.target.innerText === \"Third Trimester (24 to 40 Weeks)\") {\n      setvalue(\"Third Trimester (24 to 40 Weeks)\");\n      setcss1(css_Default + \" aa\");\n      setcss2(css_Default);\n      setcss3(css_Default);\n    } else if (e.target.innerText === \"Second Trimester (12 to 24 Weeks)\") {\n      setvalue(\"Second Trimester (12 to 24 Weeks)\");\n      setcss2(css_Default + \" aa\");\n      setcss3(css_Default);\n      setcss1(css_Default);\n    } else {\n      setvalue(\"First Trimester (Conception to 12 Weeks)\");\n      setcss3(css_Default + \" aa\");\n      setcss1(css_Default);\n      setcss2(css_Default);\n    }\n  };\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center\">\n        <div className=\"card m-2\" style={{ width: 362 }}>\n          <div className=\"card-body p-0 nav-item ${}\">\n            <Link className={css3} onClick={p}>\n              First Trimester (Conception to 12 Weeks)\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"card m-2\" style={{ width: 362 }}>\n          <div className=\"card-body p-0\">\n            <Link className={css2} onClick={p}>\n              Second Trimester (12 to 24 Weeks)\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"card m-2\" style={{ width: 362 }}>\n          <div className=\"card-body p-0\">\n            <Link className={css1} onClick={p}>\n              Third Trimester (24 to 40 Weeks)\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Pregnancy_data name={value} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Pregnancy;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/babyFoodchart.75035ca2.jpg\";","import \"./css/Heading.css\";\nimport food_chart from \"./photos/babyFoodchart.jpg\";\nfunction Baby_data(params) {\n  console.log(params);\n  if (params.name === \"Food Chart\") {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"card m-5\">\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\n          <img src={food_chart} alt=\"\" className=\"w-100 p-3\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (params.name === \"Growth Milestone\") {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"card m-5\">\n        <div className=\"card-body\"></div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"card m-5\">\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\n          <div id=\"details\">\n            <div className=\"qna\">\n              <div className=\"questions\">\n                <p>Getting Help After the Birth</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"answers\">\n                <p>\n                  Consider getting help during this time, which can be very\n                  hectic and overwhelming.

Physical closeness can promote an emotional\n                  connection.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional\n                  growth, which also affects their development in other areas,\n                  such as physical growth. Another way to think of bonding is\n                  \"falling in love\" with your baby. Children thrive from having\n                  a parent or other adult in their life who loves them\n                  unconditionally.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or\n                  her in different patterns. Both you and your partner can also\n                  take the opportunity to be \"skin-to-skin,\" holding your\n                  newborn against your own skin while feeding or cradling.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical\n                  problems, may respond to infant massage. Certain types of\n                  massage may enhance bonding and help with infant growth and\n                  development. Many books and videos cover infant massage — ask\n                  your doctor for recommendations. Be careful, however — babies\n                  are not as strong as adults, so massage your baby gently.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling,\n                  singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably also love\n                  listening to music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other\n                  good ways to stimulate your infant's hearing. If your little\n                  one is being fussy, try singing, reciting poetry and nursery\n                  rhymes, or\n                  <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/reading-babies.html\">\n                    reading\n                  </a>\n                  aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or\n                  sound, and might startle and cry easily, sleep less than\n                  expected, or turn their faces away when someone speaks or\n                  sings to them. If that's the case with your baby, keep noise\n                  and light levels low to moderate.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <b className=\"emphasis\">Swaddling</b>, which works well for some\n                  babies during their first few weeks, is another soothing\n                  technique first-time parents should learn. Proper swaddling\n                  keeps a baby's arms close to the body while allowing for some\n                  movement of the legs. Not only does swaddling keep a baby\n                  warm, but it seems to give most newborns a sense of security\n                  and comfort. Swaddling also may help limit the startle reflex,\n                  which can wake a baby.\n                </p>\n                <p>Here's how to swaddle a baby:</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded\n                    over slightly.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head\n                    above the folded corner.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Wrap the left corner over the body and tuck it beneath the\n                    back of the baby, going under the right arm.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Bring the bottom corner up over the baby's feet and pull it\n                    toward the head, folding the fabric down if it gets close to\n                    the face. Be sure not to wrap too tightly around the hips.\n                    Hips and knees should be slightly bent and turned out.\n                    Wrapping your baby too tightly may increase the chance of\n                    <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/ddh.html\">\n                      hip dysplasia\n                    </a>\n                    .\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the\n                    baby's back on the left side, leaving only the neck and head\n                    exposed. To make sure your baby is not wrapped too tight,\n                    make sure you can slip a hand between the blanket and your\n                    baby's chest, which will allow comfortable breathing. Make\n                    sure, however, that the blanket is not so loose that it\n                    could become undone.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Babies should not be swaddled after they're 2 months old.

Use one of your\n                  hands to support the head and the other hand to guide the baby\n                  in feet-first. Speaking gently, slowly lower your baby up to\n                  the chest into the tub.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair.

When you rinse the soap\n                  or shampoo from your baby's head, cup your hand across the\n                  forehead so the suds run toward the sides and soap doesn't get\n                  into the eyes.

Generally, it's\n                  recommended that babies be fed on demand — whenever they seem\n                  hungry. Your baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in\n                  his or her mouth, or making sucking noises.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  A newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours. If you're\n                  breastfeeding, give your baby the chance to nurse about 10–15\n                  minutes at each breast. If you're formula-feeding, your baby\n                  will most likely take about 2–3 ounces (60–90 milliliters) at\n                  each feeding.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Some newborns may need to be awakened every few hours to make\n                  sure they get enough to eat. Call your baby's doctor if you\n                  need to wake your newborn often or if your baby doesn't seem\n                  interested in eating or sucking.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby\n                  is getting enough to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can\n                  be a little trickier. If your baby seems satisfied, produces\n                  about six wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well,\n                  and is gaining weight regularly, then he or she is probably\n                  eating enough.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Another good way to tell if your baby is getting milk is to\n                  notice if your breasts feel full before feeding your baby and\n                  less full after feeding. Talk to your doctor if you have\n                  concerns about your child's\n                  <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/grownewborn.html\">\n                    growth\n                  </a>\n                  or feeding schedule.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them\n                  fussy. To help prevent this, burp your baby often. Try burping\n                  your baby every 2–3 ounces (60–90 milliliters) if you\n                  bottle-feed, and each time you switch breasts if you\n                  breastfeed.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  If your baby tends to be gassy, has\n                  <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/gerd-reflux.html\">\n                    gastroesophageal reflux\n                  </a>\n                  , or seems fussy during feeding, try burping your little one\n                  after every ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes\n                  during breastfeeding.\n                </p>\n                <p>Try these burping tips:</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your\n                    shoulder.

One way to help them is to keep stimulation at night\n                  to a minimum. Keep the lights low, such as by using a\n                  nightlight. Reserve talking and playing with your baby for the\n                  daytime.

Reading Signs</p>\n            <p>\n              Point out words and letters on street signs, in stores, and at the\n              doctor's office, says Sherril English, an education professor at\n              Southern Methodist University, in Dallas. Say them out loud (\"That\n              sign says stop\"), and help your child think of other\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/baby/development/intellectual/kids-rhymes/\">rhyming words</a>\n              (\"Stop sounds like hop, bop, and mop\"). To help your toddler connect\n              letters to the sounds they make, speak slowly, enunciate clearly,\n              and place your finger under the letters and words as you read.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">3. Counting Everyday Items</p>\n            <p>\n              Your 2-year-old may be able to recite the numbers one to ten in\n              order, but the ability to truly count probably won't come until\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/advice/20-tips-for-parents-from-preschool-teachers/\">his preschool days</a>, says Dr. Seaton. Still, you can bolster his number recognition by\n              tallying up totals as you get him dressed (\"One, two, three\n              buttons\"),\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/recipes/cooking/best-meal-prep-hacks-from-parents-foodies-and-cooking-pros/\">prepare meals</a>\n              (\"There are six peas on your plate\"), and shop for groceries (\"I\n              have three potatoes, so I need one more to make four\"). Use your\n              fingers when counting, and encourage him to copy you with his\n              fingers.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                RELATED:\n                <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/intellectual/math-games-for-your-toddler/\">8 Easy Math Games for Toddlers</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">4. Separating Objects by Type or Color</p>\n            <p>\n              The act of observing, comparing, and contrasting objects is a vital\n              part of early mathematics, says Dr. Seaton. Fortunately, little kids\n              are master sorters. In this learning activity for toddlers, ask your\n              child to group his stuffed animals by type (cats in one pile, bears\n              in another) or by color. See if he can separate your clean socks\n              from his\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/parenting/moms/housekeeping/laundry-tips-for-busy-moms/\">when you do the laundry</a>, and have him put different-size spoons in their proper place in\n              the silverware tray. Sometime before age 2, your child will also\n              recognize the difference between less and more. \"Ask questions like\n              'Which pile has the most and which one the least?'\" says Dr. Seaton.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">5. Making a Shape Book</p>\n            <p>\n              Lots of children's titles\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/printables/coloring-pages/printable-shapes-worksheets/\">teach kids about shapes</a>, but you can go one better by helping your toddler make her own\n              bound volume. After drawing shapes on a piece of paper, flip through\n              magazines and newspapers together and cut out items that match each\n              one, suggests English. Then go for a walk to look for other objects\n              with distinctive shapes. Snap photos of the things your child points\n              out—a square window, a round tire, a rectangular brick. Print out\n              and paste the pictures into the book when you get home and label the\n              shapes. Put multiple examples on a page to show that shapes come in\n              different sizes.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                RELATED:\n                <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/8-low-lift-crafts-for-2-year-olds-to-do-at-home/\">8 Easy Educational Crafts for 2-Year-Olds</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">6. Teaching Shapes in the Kitchen</p>\n            <p>\n              Cookies needn't always be round, and not all sandwiches are square.\n              Many\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/recipes/nutrition/foods-to-tempt-your-picky-eater/\">favorite foods</a>—pancakes, cheese slices, and bread—can be cut into triangles,\n              squares, stars, ovals, diamonds, and more. Out of the kitchen, try\n              letting your child trace shapes of cookie cutters onto a piece of\n              paper, and then help her identify and label each one, recommends\n              English.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">7. Finger Painting for Color Recognition</p>\n            <p>\n              For hands-on exposure to colors, let your child dip into\n              <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/painting/simple-art-projects-for-toddlers/\">finger paints</a>\n              as a fun learning activity for toddlers. Name the colors as he\n              spreads each one. Once the masterpiece dries, you can go on a\n              scavenger hunt around your home, looking for items that match the\n              colors used in the picture. Talk about how there are many shades of\n              colors—from pale sky blue to blue that's so dark it looks almost\n              black.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                RELATED:\n                <a href=\"https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/starting-preschool/preparing/how-to-prepare-your-child-for-preschool-0/\">How to Prepare Your Child for Preschool</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p className=\"emphasis\">8. Incorporating Colorful Language</p>\n            <p>\n              Use descriptive language as much as possible to help your child\n              recognize different colors (\"Can you put this yellow ball into the\n              blue bin?\"). At mealtime ask, \"Do you want more of the red apple or\n              the yellow banana?\" You can also try designating a day in honor of a\n              color, says English. Wear green on Thursday and eat green grapes and\n              green beans while drinking green-colored milk (a little food\n              coloring will do the trick). Then, at the end of the day, let your\n              child unwind in a bath tinted green with fizzy bath tablets.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (params.name === \"Growth Milestone\") {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"card m-5\">\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\n        <div id=\"details\">\n        <div className=\"qna\">\n          <div className=\"questions\">\n            <p>Average baby weight and length chart by month</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"answers\">\n            <p>\n              In the United States, the average baby weighs about 7 pounds 3\n              ounces (3.3 kg) at birth. Girls (at 7 pounds, 1 ounce/3.2 kg) are a\n              bit smaller than boys (at 7 pounds 4 ounces/3.3 kg) on arrival. The\n              average new-born is 19 1/2 inches (49.5 cm) long, with girls\n              measuring 19 inches (49 cm) and boys measuring 19 3/4 inches (50\n              cm).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              While most babies (both formula and breastfed) lose weight during\n              the first few days of life, within a couple of weeks they're back to\n              their birth weight. Until 3 months of age, most babies gain about an\n              ounce each day. By age 4 months, most infants have doubled their\n              birth weight, and by 1 year, most have tripled it.

But\n                  there is probably nothing kids would like more.

Kids who aren't getting the attention they want\n                  from their parents often act out or misbehave because they're\n                  sure to be noticed that way.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Many parents find it rewarding to schedule together time with\n                  their kids.

Be aware that you're constantly being\n                  watched by your kids.

If we don't take time to explain, kids will\n                  begin to wonder about our values and motives and whether they\n                  have any basis. Parents who reason with their kids allow them\n                  to understand and learn in a non-judgmental way.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Make your expectations clear. If there is a problem, describe\n                  it, express your feelings, and invite your child to work on a\n                  solution with you. Be sure to include consequences.

Parents who think\n                  in \"should\" (for example, \"My kid should be potty-trained by\n                  now\") might find it helpful to read up on the matter or to\n                  talk to other parents or child development specialists.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Kids' environments have an effect on their behaviour, so you\n                  might be able to change that behaviour by changing the\n                  environment. If you find yourself constantly saying \"no\" to\n                  your 2-year-old, look for ways to alter your surroundings so\n                  that fewer things are off-limits.
