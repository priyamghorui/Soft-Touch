                <p>
                  Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they
                  see themselves through their parents' eyes. Your tone of
                  voice, your body language, and your every expression are
                  absorbed by your kids. Your words and actions as a parent
                  affect their developing

                    self-esteem
                  </a>
                  more than anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Praising accomplishments, however small, will make them feel
                  proud; letting kids do things independently will make them
                  feel capable and strong. By contrast, belittling comments or
                  comparing a child unfavourably with another will make kids
                  feel worthless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons.
                  Comments like "What a stupid thing to do!" or "You act more
                  like a baby than your little brother!" cause damage just as
                  physical blows do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Choose your words carefully and be compassionate. Let your
                  kids know that everyone makes mistakes and that you still love
                  them, even when you don't love their behaviour.

                <p>
                  Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react
                  negatively to your kids in a given day? You may find yourself
                  criticizing far more often than complimenting. How would you
                  feel about a boss who treated you with that much negative
                  guidance, even if it was well intentioned?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something
                  right: "You made your bed without being asked — that's
                  terrific!" or "I was watching you play with your sister and
                  you were very patient." These statements will do more to
                  encourage good behaviour over the long run than repeated
                  scolding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Make a point of finding something to praise every day. Be
                  generous with rewards — your love, hugs, and compliments can
                  work wonders and are often reward enough. Soon you will find
                  you are "growing" more of the behaviour you would like to see.

                  3. Set Limits and Be Consistent With Your Discipline
                </p>
                <p>
                  Discipline is necessary in every household. The goal of
                  discipline is to help kids choose acceptable behaviours and
                  learn self-control. They may test the limits you establish for
                  them, but they need those limits to grow into responsible
                  adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Establishing house rules helps kids understand your
                  expectations and develop self-control. Some rules might
                  include: no
                  <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tv-habits.html">

                  is done, and no hitting, name-calling, or hurtful teasing
                  allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You might want to have a system in place: one warning,
                  followed by consequences such as a "time out" or loss of
                  privileges. A common mistake parents make is failure to follow
                  through with the consequences. You can't discipline kids for
                  talking back one day and ignore it the next. Being consistent
                  teaches what you expect.

                <p>
                  It's often difficult for parents and kids to get together for
                  a family meal, let alone spend quality time together. But
                  there is probably nothing kids would like more. Get up 10
                  minutes earlier in the morning so you can eat breakfast with
                  your child or leave the dishes in the sink and take a walk
                  after dinner. Kids who aren't getting the attention they want
                  from their parents often act out or misbehave because they're
                  sure to be noticed that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many parents find it rewarding to schedule together time with
                  their kids. Create a "special night" each week to be together
                  and let your kids help decide how to spend the time. Look for
                  other ways to connect — put a note or something special in
                  your kid's lunchbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adolescents seem to need less undivided attention from their
                  parents than younger kids. Because there are fewer windows of
                  opportunity for parents and teens to get together, parents
                  should do their best to be available when their teen does
                  express a desire to talk or participate in family activities.
                  Attending concerts, games, and other events with your teen
                  communicates caring and lets you get to know more about your
                  child and his or her friends in important ways.

                  Don't feel guilty if you're a working parent. It is the many
                  little things you do — making popcorn, playing cards, window
                  shopping — that kids will remember.

                <p>
                  Young kids learn a lot about how to act by watching their
                  parents. The younger they are, the more cues they take from
                  you. Before you lash out or blow your top in front of your
                  child, think about this: Is that how you want your child to
                  behave when angry? Be aware that you're constantly being
                  watched by your kids. Studies have shown that children who hit
                  usually have a role model for aggression at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Model the traits you wish to see in your kids: respect,
                  friendliness, honesty, kindness, tolerance. Exhibit unselfish
                  behaviour. Do things for other people without expecting a
                  reward. Express thanks and offer compliments. Above all, treat
                  your kids the way you expect other people to treat you.

                <p>
                  You can't expect kids to do everything simply because you, as
                  a parent, "say so." They want and deserve explanations as much
                  as adults do. If we don't take time to explain, kids will
                  begin to wonder about our values and motives and whether they
                  have any basis. Parents who reason with their kids allow them
                  to understand and learn in a non-judgmental way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Make your expectations clear. If there is a problem, describe
                  it, express your feelings, and invite your child to work on a
                  solution with you. Be sure to include consequences. Make
                  suggestions and offer choices. Be open to your child's
                  suggestions as well. Negotiate. Kids who participate in
                  decisions are more motivated to carry them out.

                <p>
                  If you often feel "let down" by your child's behaviour,
                  perhaps you have unrealistic expectations. Parents who think
                  in "should" (for example, "My kid should be potty-trained by
                  now") might find it helpful to read up on the matter or to
                  talk to other parents or child development specialists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kids' environments have an effect on their behaviour, so you
                  might be able to change that behaviour by changing the
                  environment. If you find yourself constantly saying "no" to
                  your 2-year-old, look for ways to alter your surroundings so
                  that fewer things are off-limits. This will cause less
                  frustration for both of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As your child changes, you'll gradually have to change your
                  parenting style. Chances are, what works with your child now
                  won't work as well in a year or two.

                  Teens tend to look less to their parents and more to their
                  peers for role models. But continue to provide guidance,
                  encouragement, and appropriate discipline while allowing your
                  teen to earn more independence. And seize every available
                  moment to make a connection!

                  As a parent, you're responsible for correcting and guiding
                  your kids. But how you express your corrective guidance makes

                  When you have to confront your child, avoid blaming,
                  criticizing, or fault-finding, which undermine self-esteem and
                  can lead to resentment. Instead, strive to nurture and
                  encourage, even when disciplining your kids. Make sure they

                  Face it — you are an imperfect parent. You have strengths and
                  weaknesses as a family leader. Recognize your abilities — "I
                  am loving and dedicated." Vow to work on your weaknesses — "I
                  need to be more consistent with discipline." Try to have
                  realistic expectations for yourself, your spouse, and your
                  kids. You don't have to have all the answers — be forgiving of
                  yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And try to make parenting a manageable job. Focus on the areas
                  that need the most attention rather than trying to address
                  everything all at once. Admit it when you're burned out. Take
                  time out from parenting to do things that will make you happy
                  as a person (or as a couple).

                <p>
                  Focusing on your needs does not make you selfish. It simply

                  important value to model for your children.

                  When a baby becomes part of your family, it is time to make
                  sure that your home is a safe place. Look around your home for
                  things that could be dangerous to your baby. As a parent, it
                  is your job to ensure that you create a safe home for your
                  baby. It also is important that you take the necessary steps
                  to make sure that you are mentally and emotionally ready for
                  your new baby. Here are a few tips to keep your baby safe:

                    Do not shake your baby―ever! Babies have very weak neck
                    muscles that are not yet able to support their heads. If you
                    shake your baby, you can damage his brain or even cause his
                    death.

                    Make sure you always put your baby to sleep on her back to
                    prevent sudden infant death syndrome (commonly known as
                    SIDS).

                    Protect your baby and family from secondhand smoke. Do not
                    allow anyone to smoke in your home.

                    Place your baby in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat
                    while he is riding in a car..

                    Prevent your baby from choking by cutting her food into
                    small bites. Also, don’t let her play with small toys and
                    other things that might be easy for her to swallow.

                    Don’t allow your baby to play with anything that might cover
                    her face.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Never carry hot liquids or foods near your baby or while
                    holding him.

                    Vaccines (shots) are important to protect your child’s
                    health and safety. Because children can get serious
                    diseases, it is important that your child get the right
                    shots at the right time. Talk with your child’s doctor to
                    make sure that your child is up-to-date on her vaccinations.

                    Breast milk meets all your baby’s needs for about the first
                    6 months of life. Between 6 and 12 months of age, your baby
                    will learn about new tastes and textures with healthy solid
                    food, but breast milk should still be an important source of
                    nutrition.

                    Feed your baby slowly and patiently, encourage your baby to
                    try new tastes but without force, and watch closely to see
                    if he’s still hungry.

                    Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your baby, but it
                    can be challenging. If you need help, you can call the
                    National Breastfeeding Helpline at 800-994-9662 or get help
                    on-line

                    Keep your baby active. She might not be able to run and play
                    like the “big kids” just yet, but there’s lots she can do to
                    keep her little arms and legs moving throughout the day.
                    Getting down on the floor to move helps your baby become
                    strong, learn, and explore.

                  <li>
                    Try not to keep your baby in swings, strollers, bouncer
                    seats, and exercise saucers for too long.

                    Limit screen time. For children younger than 18 months of
                    age, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends
                    that it’s best if babies do not use any screen media other
                    than video chatting.
