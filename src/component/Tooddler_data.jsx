              The world serves as one big classroom for toddlers. "They love to
              master new concepts, so it's the perfect time to lay the foundation
              for future skills like reading and counting," says Erin Seaton,
              Ed.D., a lecturer in the department of education at Tufts University
              in Medford, Massachusetts. The key is to play off
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/behavioral/new-ways-to-play-expanding-your-childs-interests/">your child's interests</a>. Here are eight fun
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/fun/games/educational/get-smart-fun-learning-activities/">learning activities</a>
              for 2- year-olds that fit into everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="emphasis">1. Displaying Her Name</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/growth/your-child-from-22-to-24-months-taming-those-terrible-twos/">Around age 2</a>, your child will begin to recognize the letters that make up her
              name, so be sure to display it throughout your home—on her bedroom
              door, a bathroom step stool, the fridge, etc. Point to the letters,
              saying each one out loud, suggests Dr. Seaton. Talk about other
              words that begin with the same letter as her name does ("C is for
              Caitlin, but it's also for cat and cup").

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="emphasis">2. Reading Signs</p>
            <p>
              Point out words and letters on street signs, in stores, and at the
              doctor's office, says Sherril English, an education professor at
              Southern Methodist University, in Dallas. Say them out loud ("That
              sign says stop"), and help your child think of other
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/baby/development/intellectual/kids-rhymes/">rhyming words</a>
              ("Stop sounds like hop, bop, and mop"). To help your toddler connect
              letters to the sounds they make, speak slowly, enunciate clearly,
              and place your finger under the letters and words as you read.
            </p>
            <p className="emphasis">3. Counting Everyday Items</p>
            <p>
              Your 2-year-old may be able to recite the numbers one to ten in
              order, but the ability to truly count probably won't come until
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/advice/20-tips-for-parents-from-preschool-teachers/">his preschool days</a>, says Dr. Seaton. Still, you can bolster his number recognition by
              tallying up totals as you get him dressed ("One, two, three
              buttons"),
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/recipes/cooking/best-meal-prep-hacks-from-parents-foodies-and-cooking-pros/">prepare meals</a>
              ("There are six peas on your plate"), and shop for groceries ("I
              have three potatoes, so I need one more to make four"). Use your
              fingers when counting, and encourage him to copy you with his
              fingers.

            </ul>
            <p className="emphasis">4. Separating Objects by Type or Color</p>
            <p>
              The act of observing, comparing, and contrasting objects is a vital
              part of early mathematics, says Dr. Seaton. Fortunately, little kids
              are master sorters. In this learning activity for toddlers, ask your
              child to group his stuffed animals by type (cats in one pile, bears
              in another) or by color. See if he can separate your clean socks
              from his
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/moms/housekeeping/laundry-tips-for-busy-moms/">when you do the laundry</a>, and have him put different-size spoons in their proper place in
              the silverware tray. Sometime before age 2, your child will also
              recognize the difference between less and more. "Ask questions like
              'Which pile has the most and which one the least?'" says Dr. Seaton.
            </p>
            <p className="emphasis">5. Making a Shape Book</p>
            <p>
              Lots of children's titles
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/printables/coloring-pages/printable-shapes-worksheets/">teach kids about shapes</a>, but you can go one better by helping your toddler make her own
              bound volume. After drawing shapes on a piece of paper, flip through
              magazines and newspapers together and cut out items that match each
              one, suggests English. Then go for a walk to look for other objects
              with distinctive shapes. Snap photos of the things your child points
              out—a square window, a round tire, a rectangular brick. Print out
              and paste the pictures into the book when you get home and label the
              shapes. Put multiple examples on a page to show that shapes come in
              different sizes.

            </ul>
            <p className="emphasis">6. Teaching Shapes in the Kitchen</p>
            <p>
              Cookies needn't always be round, and not all sandwiches are square.
              Many
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/recipes/nutrition/foods-to-tempt-your-picky-eater/">favorite foods</a>—pancakes, cheese slices, and bread—can be cut into triangles,
              squares, stars, ovals, diamonds, and more. Out of the kitchen, try
              letting your child trace shapes of cookie cutters onto a piece of
              paper, and then help her identify and label each one, recommends
              English.
            </p>
            <p className="emphasis">7. Finger Painting for Color Recognition</p>
            <p>
              For hands-on exposure to colors, let your child dip into
              <a href="https://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/painting/simple-art-projects-for-toddlers/">finger paints</a>
              as a fun learning activity for toddlers. Name the colors as he
              spreads each one. Once the masterpiece dries, you can go on a
              scavenger hunt around your home, looking for items that match the
              colors used in the picture. Talk about how there are many shades of
              colors—from pale sky blue to blue that's so dark it looks almost
              black.

            <p className="emphasis">8. Incorporating Colorful Language</p>
            <p>
              Use descriptive language as much as possible to help your child
              recognize different colors ("Can you put this yellow ball into the
              blue bin?"). At mealtime ask, "Do you want more of the red apple or
              the yellow banana?" You can also try designating a day in honor of a
              color, says English. Wear green on Thursday and eat green grapes and
              green beans while drinking green-colored milk (a little food
              coloring will do the trick). Then, at the end of the day, let your
              child unwind in a bath tinted green with fizzy bath tablets.

              In the United States, the average baby weighs about 7 pounds 3
              ounces (3.3 kg) at birth. Girls (at 7 pounds, 1 ounce/3.2 kg) are a
              bit smaller than boys (at 7 pounds 4 ounces/3.3 kg) on arrival. The
              average new-born is 19 1/2 inches (49.5 cm) long, with girls
              measuring 19 inches (49 cm) and boys measuring 19 3/4 inches (50
              cm).
            </p>
            <p>
              While most babies (both formula and breastfed) lose weight during
              the first few days of life, within a couple of weeks they're back to
              their birth weight. Until 3 months of age, most babies gain about an
              ounce each day. By age 4 months, most infants have doubled their
              birth weight, and by 1 year, most have tripled it. Most babies also
              grow about 10 inches (25 cm) by their first birthday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that babies and children have growth spurts, too –
              which means that growth isn't always a gradual, predictable process.
              Just when you start to wonder whether your child has grown enough
              lately, he may climb the charts!

              Between 12 and 24 months, most toddlers grow about 4 or 5 inches (10
              to 12 cm) and gain about 5 pounds (2.27 kg). Your little one will
              start looking more like a child than a baby as he starts to slim
              down a bit and become more muscular.

          <div className="answers">
            <p>
              Your child's genes are the biggest factor determining how tall he'll
              get and how heavy he'll be. But there are other factors, too:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Gestation:</b> If your baby arrived after her due date, she may
                be larger than average, and if she was born prematurely, she'll
                probably be smaller. (Because multiples are typically born early,
                they tend to be smaller, too.)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Your pregnancy health:</b> If you smoked or ate poorly during
                pregnancy, you're more likely to give birth to a smaller baby. If
                you gained a great deal of weight during pregnancy or had
                gestational diabetes , you're more likely to give birth to a
                larger baby.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Gender:</b> Baby girls are typically a little smaller (length
                and weight) at birth than baby boys.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Breastfed or formula fed:</b> In their first year, breastfed
                infants will gain weight more slowly than formula-fed infants, who
                will gain weight more rapidly after about 3 months of age. (For
                the first few months, the breastfed babies grow more quickly.) By
                age 2, breastfed and formula-fed babies weigh about the same.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Hormones:</b> If your child has a hormone imbalance, such as
                low growth hormone levels or a low thyroid level, it could slow
                his growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Medications:</b> Certain medications, such as regular use of
                corticosteroids, might slow growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Health issues:</b> If your child has a chronic illness (such as
                cancer, kidney disease, or cystic fibrosis), or any disorder
                affecting his ability to eat or absorb nutrients (such as
                gastrointestinal problems), his growth might be slowed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Genetic conditions:</b> Beyond your child's general genetic
                makeup (you and his dad are tall, for example), having certain
                genetic conditions – such as Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or
                Turner syndrome – could affect his growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Sleep:</b> Babies grow after sleeping, so if your baby's a good
                sleeper, he may also be a good grower!
              </li>

            <p>What do growth chart percentiles mean?</p>
          </div>
          <div className="answers">
            <p>
              Growth charts give you a general idea of how your child is growing.
              They use percentiles to compare your baby's growth to other babies
              of the same age and sex.
            </p>
            <p>
              The charts below show the height and weight (or length, for babies)
              for children of both genders in the 50th percentile, which is the
              average. Anything higher means your child is larger than average.
              Anything lower means he is smaller than average.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if your 2-month-old daughter weighs 13 pounds, she is
              heavier than average. If she is 20 inches long, she is smaller than
              average.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your doctor will normally calculate your child's weight and height
              as a percentile. If your child is in the 75th percentile for weight,
              for example, that means 74 percent of children her age and gender
              weigh less, and 24 percent weigh more.

                    To stay clean, toddlers need a bath only 2-3 times a week.
                    But they often enjoy baths more often than this.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Clean toddlers’ faces and genitals daily even if they don’t

                  </li>
                  <li>Use low-fluoride toothpaste from 18 months of age.</li>

                    Getting dressed is an important skill for children to learn
                    – but it can be hard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It helps to break getting dressed into small steps. Teaching
                    the last step first can work well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
